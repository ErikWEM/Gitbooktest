# Introducing WEM

The WEM Modeler, WEM in short, is an allround powerful rapid application creation platform that can be used by any subject matter expert without needing programming knowledge. A true no-coding development environment, which enables you to build enterprise grade applications, for use in any browser (web application) or as native app on your mobile devices.

### About the WEM Modeler

The WEM Modeler (or 'WEM') has been designed to hide the complexity of software development and deployment, enabling subject matter experts to visually create applications. We call this rapid application modeling.

Before we dive into the WEM details, let’s look at what an application exactly is.\
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application\_software): “_An application program (application or app for short) is a computer program designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user._”

To build and use an application, there are several components that make up an application, and WEM supports them all:

* All the user interface components, like buttons, forms, pictures, tables, etc. These components exist in various application screens, or application pages and are the main interface for the user to work with. Within WEM we call these pages `User Interactions`.
* All applications work with information, or data. Your application may need to store customer information, or enable users to buy a new pair of sneakers. All this information may need to be stored. In WEM, data can be stored using `Database Lists`. The WEM Datamodel provides many types of specific Fields (for text, numbers, date/time values, files and others) that can be part of a database list (so they can be stored in and retrieved from a persistent storage) or that can be used to keep values just for the duration of the user-session.
* Application logic: every application performs certain tasks and these tasks follow a certain application logic, or workflow. This is everything that happens ‘under the hood’, the engine that makes the thing work... To define how your application works, WEM uses `flowcharts`.
* Integration with external systems and applications is very important in modern applications. That can range from using Facebook to log into your application, to using complex data from ERP systems. Or even using public services to get information like ‘where is the nearest public restroom in Amsterdam’. WEM has been built with integration in mind, so there are various ways to easily and visually integrate your application with other systems. SOAP, REST/JSON, Import/Export (csv, Excel, Json, XML), SAML, OAuth, OData all have a place in WEM for easy integration in both directions (WEM as Consumer as wel as Provider of integration features).

So, WEM has everything in place to help you build your own application, whether this is an online web-application or a native mobile app.

#### Modeling an application with WEM

With the WEM Modeler, building an application is quite easy: you "draw" the logic of your application in flowcharts using the available Nodes and Connecting Lines and WEM turns this into an application. This is what we call Rapid Application Modeling.\
You can design your pages or forms, define all the data fields you need, integrate your logic with external systems/data, etc.

All the applications that are built with WEM are HTML5 compliant, so they work with all modern browsers. Furthermore, all applications are fully responsive, so they also work on your mobile device.

Learn how to use the WEM Modeler, and you will be able to build any application you need!

## Welcome aboard!

The **WEM Platform** has been designed to hide the complexity of software development and deployment, enabling subject matter experts to visually create applications without need for specific programming skills. At WEM we call this Rapid Application Modeling.

The WEM Platform was first created in 2010 and has been growing and improving ever since. &#x20;

The **WEM Modeler** is the central point in the Platform, providing the No/Low-Code environment to create and manage the applications.&#x20;

The **WEM Runtime** is the other significant element in the Platform, where the applications built in the Modeler get published to become available to the end-users.

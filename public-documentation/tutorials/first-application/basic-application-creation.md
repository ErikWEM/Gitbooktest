#### Flowcharts

This is the starting position for every project. The `Flowcharts` section is the heart of your application. They determine how your applications works and interacts with users and systems.

### Create a new flowchart

Create a new flowchart by selecting `New flowchart`, then select `Regular flowchart`.

> The difference between a `Regular` and `Action` flowchart is short: user interaction (Regular) vs NO user interaction (Action). More detailed information? Check our [online documentation](https://wem.io/documentation/wem-modeler/wem-modeler-flowcharts).

Enter a flowchart name e.g. **Companies**.

Click on `Ok` and an empty flowchart modeler canvas with only a `start node` will appear. A flowchart always consist of one `start node`. On the left side of the canvas you will find the toolbar with all the available flowchart nodes.

### Create a user interaction screen

We start with a simple user interaction screen. Drag and drop `a user interaction node`![](broken-reference) onto the canvas to the right of the `Start node`.

### Change node properties



Once you have placed a node on the canvas, you can change the properties of the selected node. The properties of a selected node are always shown on the right top side of the canvas.

Change the `Name` of the node property into `Company overview`, then click anywhere on the canvas to view the changes.

> An item (e.g. an interaction node) is selected when a blue border appears.
